# Yuzu

# What is it?

Yuzu is a simple framework and a set of complementary tools designed to solve the problem of separation and integration between the UI and CMS.

Yuzu is a (generated) pattern library composed of interlinking UI components that can create and then integrate automatically with a CMS.

# Who is it for?

For anyone creating content led, CMS driven websites.

For developers focusing is on the production quality of HTML and CSS and UI state fidelity.

For organizations that want to automate and control the production of  content-led websites.

For organizations that want to efficiently implement design patterns or pattern libraries for content-led websites.

Yuzu is closely integrated with Umbraco CMS, but the same principles apply for any CMS on any platform.

# Why?

We felt that the current selection of design systems based upon client-side frameworks (e.g. storybook) was overly complicated; they are configured in code and require a greater understanding of how to code.

By using the DNA of the UI and the dynamicity of content-led sites, Yuzu can use simpler technologies to get the same results with systems that are easier to understand and quicker to use.

Because we focus on the HTML and CSS, we free up the Javascript layer to implement one (or more) of the progressive frameworks (angular/vue/stimulus, etc.).

Yuzu opens other possibilities that would not be possible using different solutions. e.g. Bodyless Website Production
