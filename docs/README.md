# Yuzu

# What is it?

Yuzu is a simple framework and a set of complementary tools designed to solve the problem of separation and integration between the UI and a CMS.

It is a generated pattern library composed of interlinking UI components that can create then integrate automatically with CMS solutions.

# Who is it for?

Anyone creating content led or CMS driven websites that are primarily focused on the production quality of HTML and CSS and UI state fidelity.

Yuzu is closely integrated with the Umbraco CMS, but the same principles will work for any CMS on any platform.

# Why?

We felt that the current selection of design systems based upon client side frameworks (e.g storybook) were overly complicated; they are configured in code and require a greater understanding of how to code.

By using the DNA of the UI and the dynamicity of content led sites we are able to use simpler technologies to get the same results using systems that are easier to understand and quicker to use.

Because we focus on the HTML and CSS, we free up the Javascript layer to implement one (or more) of the progressive frameworks (angular/vue/stimulus etc).

Yuzu also opens up other possibilities that wouldn't be possible using other solutions.
