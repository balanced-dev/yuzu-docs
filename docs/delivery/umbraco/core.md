## Umbraco Import Config

Ignore the data image and link from IgnoreViewmodels and ExcludeViewmodelsAtGeneration.

## ToModel

When building Umbraco sites working with teh model builder it is common to end up with single standard Umbraco nodes objects (IPublishedContent and IPublishedElement). It can be difficult to safely convert these into strongly typed object. We have created an extension method safely makes this conversion.

``` c#
content.ToModel<HomePage>();
content.ToElement<CTA>();
```
