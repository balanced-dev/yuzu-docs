# About
This is the documentation project for the Yuzu framework and other tools. Many elements of Yuzu are open source, including its documentation. We welcome all pull requests that help to make our documentation easier for anyone to understand.

## Project setup

We have used [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) to create our documentation. It's simple to setup, just a collection of markdown files. And it will be easy to migrate to a different solution when we outgrow it.

The following installs docsify globally

``` bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Then to preview the site 

``` bash
docsify serve docs
```

The preview will be available on [localhost](https://localhost:3000)
